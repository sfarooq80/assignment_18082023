// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

let loc:string = "aPeshawar";
let check = loc=="Peshawar" ?  "predict True":"not correct";
console.log( check );
console.log(loc==="Peshawar");

let name_1:string = "hamza";
console.log(name_1=="hamza" ? "student":"not student");

let occupation = "engineer";
console.log(occupation=="doctor"? true:false)
