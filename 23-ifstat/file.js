// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
var loc = "aPeshawar";
var check = loc == "Peshawar" ? "predict True" : "not correct";
console.log(check);
console.log(loc === "Peshawar");
var name_1 = "hamza";
console.log(name_1 == "hamza" ? "student" : "not student");
var occupation = "engineer";
console.log(occupation == "doctor" ? true : false);
